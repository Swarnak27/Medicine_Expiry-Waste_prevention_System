# Medicine Waste & Expiry Tracker for Pharmacies

This project helps local pharmacies track medicine batches, manage stocks across multiple branches, and identify medicine wastage due to expiry. It is built using **MySQL** and includes realistic sample data and queries for analysis and reporting.

## Problem Statement

Pharmacies often accumulate expired or unused medicine batches due to poor tracking systems. This leads to financial losses and environmental hazards. This SQL-based system aims to:

- Identify upcoming or past expiry medicines.
- Track available vs. wasted quantities.
- Optimize stock distribution across branches.
- Reduce wastage and improve operational efficiency.

## Database Schema

The system uses the following tables:

1. **Medicines** - Stores details about medicines.
2. **Batches** - Tracks batch-level info including expiry and received dates.
3. **Branches** - Represents pharmacy branches.
4. **Stock** - Tracks medicine quantity per batch per branch.
5. **Waste_Log** - Stores records of wasted medicines with reasons.
